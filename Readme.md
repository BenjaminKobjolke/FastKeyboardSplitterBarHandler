# Usage

# Step 1: create a screenshot of the splitter bars

- activate the window with the splitter bars
- move the mouse over the bar, make sure the mouse icon changes to the "dragable icon"
- press ctrl shit e, wait
- your mouse will be moved aside and a screenshot will be taken
- a small window pops up, asking you for a name of the window this screenshot is related to. Shorten the default to something that is universal and still unique for this window. Example: Suggestions is "Yadda Yaddaaa - Notepad - Notepad.exe" then you probably should use Notepad.exe and remove the rest from the input.

# Step 2: Use the keyboard to move the splitter

- press ctrl shift w
- you will see some red circles with digits and letters where the splitter bars were found in the current window
- press the desired digit / letter
- your mouse will move to those coordinates
- use hjkl to move the splitter around
- press esc when you are done
- your mouse will move back to it's original position
